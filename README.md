# pylox
Python 3.10+ implementation of the Lox programming language from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

### Some notes:

 - Requires python 3.10+ due to the use of pattern matching.
 - Type hinting is partially compelete, but mypy doesn't support pattern matching yet so I can't actually run the static checks.
